                                Golf pits one against oneself so consistently thus making it a very unique sport. Building sound fundamentals is absolutely necessary and as the legend Seve Ballesteros said <strong>“we spend hours on the fundamentals of the game because they are fundamental”</strong>.

	                    	<div class="more-features-box-text-description">
	                    		Each individual has to build and find their <strong>own</strong> swing. This really means that while the fundamentals form the framework, one has to retain individuality.

	                    	<div class="more-features-box-text-description">
	                    		The key to building a good game quickly is to have a sharp short game. Having a great short game can relieve pressure on tee and approach shots. Golf really is about <strong>converting 3 shots to 2</strong>. Golf is best learnt from Green to Tee (Harvey Penick).

There is a lot of discipline needed to do this consistently. It's not easy to keep things simple on the golf course. All the training has to be left aside and one has to switch to a trusting mode-let things flow and experience the <strong>zone</strong>.<br/>Through the following programs, one can learn how to practice, improve and strategize. An <span class="colored-text">essential component </span>of this program is having someone to constantly bounce ideas and assess progress.

He helped me a lot by opening my eyes to new stages of opportunity and strength in my game. His vast knowledge about golf and the way he builds the mental game helped my confidence immensely. He made me look at things in my game in a different light. His manner is open and approachable, his advice is very practical and relatable in many fields of life, and draws on his vast experience as a keen student of golf and his ability to mentor folks from various walks of life. I could listen to his stories for hours! Whilst he remains firm in his critique, he is positive, patient and encouraging. I’m grateful for his guidance and would recommend the experience highly"<br>

Over the years he has been the most consistent person I’ve met. His unwavering passion towards Golf and Life, his attention to fundamentals and his sincerity have remained his trademarks. Whether a beginner or a professional, he teaches intuitively from all the knowledge distilled over the years, without holding back.He has taught me not just to play golf but to enjoy every moment while playing it and to live life simply and fully.

I have learnt a lot about business, music, psychology etc in his company due to his broad interest and sharp mind. He has made me work towards realising my full potential by encouraging, coaxing and censuring in just the right proportion. His optimism and high energy levels are contagious and it is always an energising experience spending time with him. It is through him I was led to the teachings of my Guru Ramana Maharshi, and for that I’m always indebted to him. His friendship through Golf has altered the direction and meaning of Life itself, as I am now a spiritual warrior in a material world,equipped to survive the vagaries that Golf and Life throw at you!"<br>

His knowledge and passion for the game, a rare and genuine drive to see his students improve (on and off the course) and his ability to teach things in a way that make them subliminal very quickly, are just some of the things that I found make the golfing journey unique. A standard session with Vasu could involve everything from home drills, visualisation, smile therapy, chanting, anagrams that play on repeat inside your head, target practice, process orientation and so much more - you learn to think and play like a golfer, not just play golf. 

I've found myself better for every session and every round with Vasu. Most importantly I know I'm learning from the best and never have to second guess any correction or suggestion."<br>

imparting golfing wisdoms he makes us look at ourselves - our illusions evaporate
and we reach our better selves - at work, at home and of course - the golf course! 
He goads you into looking at things in a positive and ever improving light -
shedding inhibitions, defeatism and negative energy to come out a better person
and professional. Indeed I am lucky to have met him and have him as a coach and
now also a dear respected friend.

As you would recall, you asked me if I was ready to go back to basics in spite of having played golf for over 15 years and I was. Within a short time, I realized that it is the small things that add up to not only one's golf technique but also approach, temperament, etc. Even though I had read about some of the techniques you use, it is the discussions and practice sessions that really helped me to solidify my technique.

                        <p style="text-align:justify">I am a self taught golfer who picked up the golf club for the first time when I was 36, an age that many would consider too late; 4 years on I was playing to scratch and doing things on a golf course that should have taken me much longer. My accolades have not been extraordinary, however over the years I did achieve something quite extraordinary as well - I lived up to my full potential, and became the best possible golfer that I could have been; in more ways than one this thoroughly validates my methodology. Right from the beginning, I have rarely played more than a round a week but have consistently trained at home!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" >

 As a coach, this is the same journey I bring to the lives of the people I work with - to bow down to this great game, be the best possible player you can be and enjoy the process more than the final number. Over the years, I am and will always remain a very keen student of this divine sport.</p>
