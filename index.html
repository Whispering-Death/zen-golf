                                Golf pits one against oneself so consistently thus making it a very unique sport. Building sound fundamentals is absolutely necessary and as the legend Seve Ballesteros said <strong>“we spend hours on the fundamentals of the game because they are fundamental”</strong>.

	                    		Each individual has to build and find their <strong>own</strong> swing. This really means that while the fundamentals form the framework, one has to retain individuality.

	                    	<div class="more-features-box-text-description">
	                    		The key to building a good game quickly is to have a sharp short game. Having a great short game can relieve pressure on tee and approach shots. Golf really is about <strong>converting 3 shots to 2</strong>. Golf is best learnt from Green to Tee (Harvey Penick).

There is a lot of discipline needed to do this consistently. It's not easy to keep things simple on the golf course. All the training has to be left aside and one has to switch to a trusting mode-let things flow and experience the <strong>zone</strong>.<br/>Through the following programs, one can learn how to practice, improve and strategize. An <span class="colored-text">essential component </span>of this program is having someone to constantly bounce ideas and assess progress.

He helped me a lot by opening my eyes to new stages of opportunity and strength in my game. His vast knowledge about golf and the way he builds the mental game helped my confidence immensely. He made me look at things in my game in a different light. His manner is open and approachable, his advice is very practical and relatable in many fields of life, and draws on his vast experience as a keen student of golf and his ability to mentor folks from various walks of life. I could listen to his stories for hours! Whilst he remains firm in his critique, he is positive, patient and encouraging. I’m grateful for his guidance and would recommend the experience highly</p>

Vasuki found in me an eager student-with his help, my handicap dropped quickly and dramatically till I held my lowest handicap of 7. His focus of course was on fundamentals! My Golf became infused with the joy of learning new shots, creating new ones and building a good repeatable swing.  Practice was always fun with high intensity and never a chore.

The joy led to a of lot improvement, which resulted in  many wins in amateur club tournaments. The icing on the cake was winning the BMW national final at DLF in 2015 and going to South Africa, representing the Indian team. Many thanks to Vasuki. The fundamentals are so ingrained that I don’t miss a beat after not playing months at a time.  Pre-Vasuki days, any gap meant starting all the way from ground zero which was very frustrating. 
I was very comfortable playing blades, be they Honmas or Mizunos and playing with any club Vasuki would put in my hand.  He made sure there was constant expansion in my game and I can never forget learning to get the ball out of a greenside bunker with my 5 iron!  Golf is a game of possibilities and self-belief and lot of the training covered these two critical aspects of the game. With Vasuki golf became an art where creativity ruled. There have been many rounds where I played with just 5 clubs, used 3 different clubs for the same distance- these exercises had a significant impact on my game. Thanks to him I have longevity in my game and can put together a good round of golf whenever, wherever and with whatever club you put in my hand.</p>

His knowledge and passion for the game, a rare and genuine drive to see his students improve (on and off the course) and his ability to teach things in a way that make them subliminal very quickly, are just some of the things that I found make the golfing journey unique. A standard session with Vasu could involve everything from home drills, visualisation, smile therapy, chanting, anagrams that play on repeat inside your head, target practice, process orientation and so much more - you learn to think and play like a golfer, not just play golf. 
In many ways, my first ever round of golf at Eagleton was a testament to everything I've described so far. For a beginner nailing the 387 yard PAR 4 15th hole was tangible validation of everything the program entailed. I've found myself better for every session and every round with Vasu. Most importantly I know I'm learning from the best and never have to second guess any correction or suggestion.</p>

imparting golfing wisdoms he makes us look at ourselves - our illusions evaporate

He goads you into looking at things in a positive and ever improving light -
shedding inhibitions, defeatism and negative energy to come out a better person
and professional. Indeed I am lucky to have met him and have him as a coach and
now also a dear respected friend. </p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify">I am a self taught golfer who picked up the golf club for the first time when I was 36, an age that many would consider too late; 4 years on I was playing to scratch and doing things on a golf course that should have taken me much longer. My accolades have not been extraordinary, however over the years I did achieve something quite extraordinary as well - I lived up to my full potential, and became the best possible golfer that I could have been; in more ways than one this thoroughly validates my methodology. Right from the beginning, I have rarely played more than a round a week but have consistently trained at home!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" >

 As a coach, this is the same journey I bring to the lives of the people I work with - to bow down to this great game, be the best possible player you can be and enjoy the process more than the final number. Over the years, I am and will always remain a very keen student of this divine sport.</p>
