He helped me a lot by opening my eyes to new stages of opportunity and strength in my game. His manner is open and approachable, his advice is very practical and relatable in many fields of life, and draws on his vast experience as a keen student of golf. Whilst he remains firm in his critique, he is positive, patient and encouraging. I’m grateful for his guidance and would recommend him to anyone who's serious about golf.</p>

Vasuki found in me an eager student-with his help, my handicap dropped quickly and dramatically till I held my lowest handicap of 7. His focus of course was on fundamentals!. Practice was always fun with high intensity and never a chore.

The joy led to a of lot improvement, which resulted in  many wins in amateur club tournaments. The icing on the cake was winning the BMW national final at DLF in 2015 and going to South Africa, representing the Indian team. Many thanks to Vasuki. The fundamentals are so ingrained that I don’t miss a beat after not playing months at a time.  Pre-Vasuki days, any gap meant starting all the way from ground zero which was very frustrating. 
I was very comfortable playing blades, be they Honmas or Mizunos and playing with any club Vasuki would put in my hand.  He made sure there was constant expansion in my game and I can never forget learning to get the ball out of a greenside bunker with my 5 iron!  Golf is a game of possibilities and self-belief and lot of the training covered these two critical aspects of the game. Thanks to him I have longevity in my game and can put together a good round of golf whenever, wherever and with whatever club you put in my hand.</p>

His knowledge and passion for the game, a rare and genuine drive to see his students improve (on and off the course) and his ability to teach things in a way that make them subliminal very quickly, are just some of the things that I found make the golfing journey unique. A standard session with Vasu could involve everything from home drills, visualisation, smile therapy, chanting, anagrams that play on repeat inside your head, target practice, process orientation and so much more - you learn to think and play like a golfer, not just play golf.

From years of incorrect guidance, I had ingrained many bad habits that made my game extremely erratic. My problem was that I had never learned the fundamentals properly so in order to learn the correct technique I first had to unlearn. This took me months but with his coaching I was able to make it happen and that's when I started to see results.

Out of all the golfers I've met, and I've met many including the big name coaches and players, Vasu stands out for his passion and knowledge of the game. He's the kind of person that would try anything if it could give him a 1% improvement. If you've ever visited his house you'd get all the evidence you need. He has an entire library dedicated to golf literature with all the classics to lesser known writers who's books probably weren't good but he bought them anyway just to see if there was anything worth learning. And don't get me started on his club collection. He has clubs you didn't know existed and with a lot of modifications. 

His coaching sessions are the best I've ever had. He has an infectious enthusiasm that immediately puts you in a good mood when you meet him at the range. But the real fun begins when he starts making you do drills/exercises. He has the greatest repertoire of drills I've ever seen in a coach. After analyzing your swing for a few shots, like a precision watch maker, he pulls out a tool from his toolkit (golf drill) that will make your swing fall apart to show you your folly. He then makes you do other drills that will show you the kind of shots you'd only dream of.

But the main reason why he's a great coach is because he's a solid man. Not the kind that would tell you what you want to hear, or the kind that would give you generic advice to kill time, or the kind that would feign interest but inwardly despise you. When he takes you on as a student, he is more committed than you in your success and will stop at nothing, even if that means giving you a dressing down which I've experienced many times.

Golf is a very very difficult sport. Even at the highest levels (I'm speaking from experience having played with some of India's best golfers) it's a constant struggle. Do yourself a favour and take coaching from the best coach there is. It will make the journey less stressful and you'll even play some good golf.

A self taught golfer, he has been constantly learning and refining his game as well as his coaching methodologies. I remember taking a chipping lesson from him. He came prepared including getting his own music! He approaches golf and teaching golf almost as if it his sacred bound duty. He is completely present when he is with you and means business. He speaks about the game passionately and you can’t help but learn and improve. I also love the emphasis that he places on the mental aspect of this game and the art of scoring. Thanks to him I read a classic by Raymond Floyd which shaped the way I think and play golf. Over a period of 18 months I shaved 3 strokes of my handicap.  I learnt much during a visit to his home that houses a very fine collection of putters which he treats with amazing affection!.</p>

Since I had absolutely no clue about this sport, I was very fortunate to be pointed in the direction of Vasuki. It started with a visit to his home and he introduced me to golf with an excellent presentation followed by answering all my questions. There was no debate about signing up for his program and in retrospect I am glad I made that decision. The sessions were very enjoyable and intense and I really enjoyed his style of coaching. His emphasis on fundamentals and his passion for the game is something to  exprience first hand. I have had no problems with respect to injury thanks to good fundamentals and technique. Post our program, I  still report on my progress and work on his comments / inputs which I value immensely. I dedicate my progress and the enjoyment from golf to him - Thank you very much ...</p>

Vasuki knows how to raise the level of one's game - his training helped me maintain a certain level of scoring even during my bad rounds. He really sharpened my short game and ironed out some key flaws in my swing in just 4 sessions. Thanks to him, I cut 3 strokes off my handicap to drop to 12 in just 8 weeks. I have had some very good results in various tournaments and am motivated to keep improving my game.</p>

As you would recall, you asked me if I was ready to go back to basics in spite of having played golf for over 15 years and I was. Within a short time, I realized that it is the small things that add up to not only one's golf technique but also approach, temperament, etc. Even though I had read about some of the techniques you use, it is the discussions and practice sessions that really helped me to solidify my technique.</p>

It has been a long desire to get onto a golf course and play. This was therefore a dream come true.The entire game took me back to my first session with you. I was also very grateful for the value in learning right and beginning with the short game. Getting onto the course made me realise the importance of the short game.
